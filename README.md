# theta
Use shortcuts to type words and letters - ex: ϴ (OPT-T)


To add shortcuts just open the user preferences file (Under Brackets or Debug Menus).

You will see this:

    "theta.shortcuts": {
        "OPT_T": "ϴ",
        "OPT_H": "hello world"
    }

This means that when you type OPT_T, it will print ϴ (theta);

You can add any words or letter you want, I use it for greek letters in math.

Notes:

If you change what is typed, but not the keys you enter ("OPT_T"), you have to reset brackets for it to register.

If you delete a shortcut, you need to reload brackets for it to register.

To reset Brackets: (Debug->Reload With Extensions)
